The `tgswitch` command line tool lets you switch between different versions of <a href="https://terragrunt.gruntwork.io/" target="_blank">terragrunt</a>. 
If you do not have a particular version of terragrunt installed, `tgswitch` will download the version you desire.
The installation is minimal and easy. 
Once installed, simply select the version you require from the dropdown and start using terragrunt.
